Ice "0"{{fn Tentative name; final phase name should be given when it is discovered experimentally.}} is a metastable ice polymorph discovered in the supercooled liquid water by computer simulations.[1]  According to our Vitrite Database,[2] ice 0 consists of two type of fragments; one is [[#34|vitrite:34]] fragment of 10 nodes (appeared as fragment "G" in Ref. 2) and the other is [[#874|vitrite:874]] fragment of 14 nodes.  Their appearance ratio is 1:1.  Their network topologies are: (in @NGPH format)

The vitrite [[#34|vitrite:34]] is abundant in the supercooled liquid water while the vitrite  [[#874|vitrite:874]] is very rare.  Even the spontaneous clustering of [[#34|vitrite:34]] and [[#874|vitrite:874]] is not observed in the supercooled liquid.
