Ice "0"[^1](^1) is a metastable ice polymorph discovered in the supercooled liquid water by computer simulations.[1](1)  According to our [Vitrite Database](/Vitrite Database),[2](2) ice 0 consists of two type of fragments; one is [#34](/vitrite:34) fragment of 10 nodes (appeared as fragment "G" in Ref. 2) and the other is [#874](/vitrite:874) fragment of 14 nodes.  Their appearance ratio is 1:1.  Their network topologies are: (in [@NGPH](/@NGPH) format)

The [vitrite](/vitrite) [#34](/vitrite:34) is abundant in the supercooled liquid water while the [vitrite](/vitrite)  [#874](/vitrite:874) is very rare.  Even the spontaneous clustering of [#34](/vitrite:34) and [#874](/vitrite:874) is not observed in the supercooled liquid.
